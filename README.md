# 🦀 Learning Rust: A Project-Based Journey

A hands-on approach to mastering Rust through progressively challenging projects. This repository documents my intensive learning sprint, focusing on practical implementation over theoretical knowledge.

## 📚 Learning Philosophy

**Learn → Build → Review → Refactor**

Instead of reading exhaustively before coding, I:
1. Learn just enough from [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) to start building
2. Implement projects that reinforce specific concepts
3. Seek feedback and review my approach
4. Refactor as I discover better patterns and idiomatic Rust

> **⚠️ Disclaimer:** This is a learning repository. Code quality improves as projects progress. Earlier projects may be revisited and refactored as I gain deeper understanding of Rust's patterns and best practices.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Master Rust fundamentals: ownership, borrowing, lifetimes
- Build confidence with traits, generics, and error handling
- Understand async programming and concurrency
- Learn to work with Rust's ecosystem (crates, Cargo)
- Develop muscle memory for idiomatic Rust patterns

## 📋 Project Roadmap

## 🏗️ Repository Structure

```

├── README.md                    # This file
├── guessing_game/              # Level 1 projects
├── temp_converter/

└── http_fetcher/               # Level 4+ projects
```

Each project is a standalone Cargo workspace with its own `Cargo.toml` and dependencies.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run any project:

```bash
cd project_name
cargo run
```

To run tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

## 📈 Progress Tracking

- **Current Focus:** Mini CSV Parser
- **Completed Projects:** 9/15
- **Lines of Code Written:** ~2,000+

## 🔄 Iteration & Improvement

As I progress, earlier projects may be refactored to incorporate:
- Better error handling patterns
- More idiomatic Rust code
- Additional features that demonstrate new concepts
- Improved documentation and tests

This iterative approach mirrors real-world software development and reinforces learning.

## 🤝 Feedback Welcome

This is a learning journey, and I'm actively seeking:
- Code review and suggestions for improvement
- Idiomatic Rust patterns I might have missed
- Better approaches to problem-solving in Rust
- General feedback on project structure and architecture

## 📝 Notes

- Projects increase in complexity and introduce new Rust concepts progressively
- Each project folder contains its own README with specific learning objectives
- Some projects may have multiple iterations as I refactor with new knowledge
- Focus is on understanding **why** Rust works this way, not just **how** to write it
